# transfer-of-thermal-and-kinetic-energy-in-crystal-structures
A dense crystaline structure with a fault tolerance to withstand extreme temperatures is able to store kinetic energy. A crystal will vibrate from heat absorbed from the surroundings. The amount of heat gained will create resonance within a crystal which can be released as kinetic energy and heat when the crystaline structure is put under pressure.
