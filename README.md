# transfer-of-thermal-and-kinetic-energy-in-crystal-structures

A dense crystaline structure with a fault tolerance to withstand extreme temperatures is able to store kinetic energy. A crystal will vibrate from heat absorbed from the surroundings. The amount of heat gained will create resonance within a crystal which can be released as kinetic energy and heat when the crystaline structure is put under pressure.

Crystals can be charged from geothermal energy resources, and can be used as reusable long term energy storage mediums for multiple applications.
